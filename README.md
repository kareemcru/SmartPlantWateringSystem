# SmartPlantWateringSystem
A plant watering system that will alleviate the burden of being born green thumbless! 
This smart watering system can maintain plant health both automatically and manually from anywhere in the world of WiFi 
# Overview
This plant watering system has the capability to *communicate with you* wherever you are as long as you have a phone with service. 
Furthermore, it will be able to maintain the most **vibrant colors** and **complexion** of any plant simply by measuring the plants moisture level 
and constantly setting it to match that environment. The system utilizes a DC motor component, which will act like a pump in order to continously 
keep the plant at **optimal hydration** levels. The system, along with its *multiple components*, work together to gather and display data from the environment around you
such as **air quality, or temperature!**

# Summary
The overall project of making a Smart Plant Watering System began on *19-Apr-2021* and took till around 1700 on *22-Apr-2021* to finish constructing. The process overall was 
challenging in the implementation of the two Seeed devices because I had not worked with those prior to this project. Their integration from Seeeduino into Visual Studio Code
was difficult but looking at other source code helped aid that process. Furthemore, the implementations of a watering system that would dual as a self sustaining system was
difficult due to the design of the flowerpots and flowerpots holder. The difficulty lies within the clogging of the drainage avenues designed for these tasks and the overall lack of time.
Publishing and subscribing feeds on Adafruit.io was a rather simple task to complete due to its repetitive nature but the combining of Zapier made that process a little bit more difficult.
Designing the asethetics of this project was rather easy because I bought most of the pieces at the store in order to be able to fully focus on the coding and Wifi implications. In conclusion, 
this project has major advantages to improving the quality of life for day to day Americans and I am excited to see what further projects or IoTers will do with this piece of information.
